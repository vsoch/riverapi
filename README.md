# River API Client

This is an API client created for [django-river-ml](https://pypi.org/project/django-river-ml/)
that is intended to make it easy to interact with an online ML server providing river models (learning, predicting, etc.).
It currently does not provide a terminal  or command line client and is intended to be used
from Python, but if there is a good use case for a command line set of interactions
this can be added.

**under development**

not ready for use!
